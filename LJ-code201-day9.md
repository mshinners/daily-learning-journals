# LJ Code 201 - Day 9

Today I learned about sticking with this coding thing, even when Im frustrated. I learned that small and even medium wins can be huge for learning and building my self confidence with coding.

In practice, I learned how to figure out how to work through my code and learned a bit more about what certain things do. I got a good understanding about eventListeners and handlers.

I feel I took strong personal steps forward today!
