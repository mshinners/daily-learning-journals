# LJ Code 201 - Day 12

I need more repetition of this code to get it solidified. Each day I work on it, more of it starts to make sense. I rely too heavily on my classmates and TAs, I need to be more self-sustaining. Although, I also recognize that being too far the other way (not asking for enough help) would be a worse position. At least I am seeing working code, muddling through the process and have some mini-victories.

I thoroughly appreciated the 401 forum today. It was helpful to get a glimpse into the future of this career path.
