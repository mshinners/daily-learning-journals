# LJ Code 301 - Day 12

Today, in lecture, we learned more about APIs, specifically how to use github's API via keys. We learned how to use this authentication key by entering it into our .bashrc file, assigning it a variable name, and then calling that in our code to be able to securely access our repos, but not having to keep our key in our code (which github would disable anyways.) We also learned about REST and how it is used to help cut down on traffic flow.

In code, I'm starting to get an inkling of an idea of how some of the back-end-to-front-end communication takes place, but I don't think I could put it into words. But I did have a few minor 'ah-ha' moments yesterday.
