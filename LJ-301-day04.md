# LJ Code 301 - Day 04

Today I learned that I don't know much about Ternery operations. In it's simplest form, they are fairly straight-forward, but as you went deeper into code-review, it just made less and less sense. Actually not really less sense, more about just plain confusing. I'm not sure , but probably if I knew more about code up to that level, I would be able grasp it better.

I continue to clunk along, picking up more and more understanding of previously learned code. When I compare myself to myself, I see that I have grown a great deal in my code knowledge.
