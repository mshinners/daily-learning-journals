# LJ Code 301 - Day 20

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Today I learned, that I am done with 301!!!!

I learned that Python is going to be seriously hard. No, I mean it. Really HARD!! I don't think I understand how hard this is going to be. But I will. in about 11 weeks!

I learned the use of several more jQuery functions that I either hadn't used before, or just hadn't understood previously.

I learned that you are an awesome teacher, that pushes us to learn more and try to break through our limits.  Thank you!
