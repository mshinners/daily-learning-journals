# LJ Code 301 - Day 10

Today I learned about IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions.) I have an understanding of how and why they are used. It wraps all the global functions into itself to prevent things from being maliciously. The function is immediately called, but I'm still unclear as to how all the functions inside the IIFE are then interacted with? I know calls are to be written within the bottom portion of the IIFE, but I don't understand that part of the concept.

I also learned about FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING. Specifically using .map, .filter & .reduce. I only have an inkling of their use, but I will be studying them more over the weekend.
