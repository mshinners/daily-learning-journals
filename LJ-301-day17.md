# LJ Code 301 - Day 17

Today I learned that APIs are REALLY hard to understand with how they like to be communicated. Especially if they don't have specific docs for your language. In that long, drawn-out process, I feel I did get a clearer view of how the front end and back end talk to one another. So I've got that going for me, which is nice!
