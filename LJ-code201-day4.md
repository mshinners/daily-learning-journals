# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

It's amazing what a day can do. I was feeling like I was starting to go under water a bit. After going though morning lecture and pair programming, I feel like I've gained a great deal usable knowledge. The fear that I've had about functions has proven to be greatly diminished. I am excited to see the power that I may be able you create with their use.

CSS, on the other hand is still quite a burden for me, if fact I'm sitting here contemplating whether or not to go home or work on my CSS.

Quiz \#2 proved to be a greater challenge for me than the 1st. There was more in-depth code that had not yet been taught, and a couple others that I thought I should know, but just wasn't able to conjure up the answers. It took me 7 tries!!!

I'm preparing to work on my CSS tonight, and likely through the weekend.
