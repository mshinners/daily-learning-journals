# LJ Code 201 - Day 8

Today I learned....

I learned to cope with frustration....sorta. I had to fight off regular bouts of doubt & fret. But again I persevered.

I learned about forms and events. Event listeners seem to be a rather nifty way of make things happen dynamically. I learned how to draw out my problem and to try and work through a problem backwards to have a different perspective on the solution.
