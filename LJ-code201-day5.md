# LJ Code 201 - Day 5

Day 5 was a day of strong learning and high stress. Trying to complete our first coding challenges was eye-opening and eye-splitting! I am so glad we  have a strong collaboration amongst so many of our classmates. Trying to get these done as a solo venture would have been quite demoralizing. I still have a challenge with recognizing the various elements in some particular formulas and how to properly order things. I get a glimmer of an idea, or someone teaches me a piece of the puzzle, I seem to get the essence of it, but soon after, I either confuse myself, or get something else out-of-sorts that then throws off what I just learned. I do feel confident that after repeated practice, I will start to understand some of these nuances.

I do feel that I gained some useful CSS information, that between yesterday and today, I can start fresh with my stylesheet and make something that looks half-way decent.
