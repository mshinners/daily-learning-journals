# LJ Code 301 - Day 11

I've just completed reading all the assignments so that's whats currently in my head for what I've learned. I was impressed with some of the findings from the diversity articles. While I don't fully agree with the video game-to-tech savvy theory in the first one it does have some points worth consideration. Further, I was pleased to learn of the diversity-to-profit ratio that was discovered, and hope that will lead to a continued growth in the workplace as a whole, not only in tech.

In class, we learned about Single Page Applications (SPAs). And how the use of them can reduce data transfers, increase responsiveness and user satisfaction.
