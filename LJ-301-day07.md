# LJ Code 301 - Day 07

Today I learned that I think I am going to like the backend! Sitting in lecture today, I understood the process for just about everything we discussed. It all made sense to me. I don't remember everything that was said, nor will understand exactly how to implement it, but I understood the principles of everything. There was nothing that was downright mind-boggling (as with so much of the front-end logic & code structure for me.) If this is any precursor to how the rest of the class will go, I feel excited for the remainder. I'm excited to learn it all, but this gives me a reduced sense of dread, lol.
