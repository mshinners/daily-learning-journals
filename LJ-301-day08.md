# LJ Code 301 - Day 08

Today I learned about SQL, more about Node, Express and practiced their usage in the terminal. There was a load of info thrown at us in Code review. I continue to understand the server side better than front-side logic. Not that I could tell you very much as I write this off the top of my head. Well, let me try that.....

The basic principles to setting up a server and to have it communicate with a client:

G - Get
U - Use
L - Listen
P - Post

Set up the server to 'Listen' for a client via a port: for our purposes in class, we're using 3000, but it appears that 8080 is the default for live servers. The server listens for the client to send a 'Get' or 'Post' request. Get-ting would be the clients request to get data from the server. Post-ing would be the client requesting their data to be posted to the server, or it's database. Use-ing (please forgive spelling-I'm trying to make my point) would be requesting that current data (or database) be used...somehow.

A new component that really messes up my acronym is Delete. And it does just what the name says (similar to the above.)

Syntax for this is where I will need more practice to get down, but the basics I (think I) understand;

app.get('/filePathName', function(request, response) {
  response.sendFile('index.html', {root: './public'});
}


....but now after Thursday morning's Grocery Store mob code, I don't think I understand as much as I thought I did last night.
