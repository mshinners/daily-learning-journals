# LJ Code 301 - Day 18

Today I learned that I can still learn this stuff. Its been a struggle, but I know I can persevere. I got some more practice on how to install and use a npm library, I am getting better at processing the communication between front end and back end, and getting schooled in just how physically exhausting mental exercise can be. I am wiped out! I am excited for Presentation day. I think we have an interesting product.
