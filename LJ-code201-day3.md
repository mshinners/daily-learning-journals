# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

I am realizing that I seem to grasp the majority of the concepts during discussion time, but when it comes time to put them into practice, I either can't remember the structure, our have flat-out lost the concept all-together. When working with my partners, I am able to muddle through the coursework, but feel I am not truly learning the most advanced things that we're working on that day. But once I am able to get the pieces of the puzzle to fit into their proper place, it is quite a feeling to see the program work. Knowing that I've created something - no matter with how many helping hands - I know it's my creation, which is most exciting!

Perhaps this is that *Imposter Syndrome* that I've heard about, but I do know that the parts that I feel comfortable with today, were also parts that I struggled with a couple weeks ago in 101 & 102.
