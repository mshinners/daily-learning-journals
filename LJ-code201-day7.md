# LJ Code 201 - Day 7

Constructor functions and tables. Once seems very hard and the other very easy. No, not that way, believe it or not, tables proved to be the most challenging for me. Not the building of them, but the creation of them from JS and implementation of data into them.
I also learned about grit. The Ted talk was very well timed. its a good watch and I will keep it saved for a quick mind check whenever i need it.
