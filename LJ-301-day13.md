# LJ Code 301 - Day 13

Today, we learned all about Heroku, and how to live deploy our own sites.

I also learned some new nuggets of info about the tech community during a meet-up last night. About functional languages like Haskell and Skala(sp?) and techniques companies use for keeping their code secure. It involves peer review and passing code in through github so the main code base is never touched by humans. If new features need to be added, they write it, it gets reviewed, uploaded to github and then some bit of code is run remotely that inserts the new code into the base. I found it to be quite an interesting process.
