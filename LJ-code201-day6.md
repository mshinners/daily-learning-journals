# LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Day 6, known as the most difficult day in all of 201. And that it was. I did, however, manage to learn some things in all of today's tribulation.

Today, I've learned what the DOM is, and how browsers create a copy of the websites it opens and this copy is called the Tree. And on this tree are nodes. And I've learned all about the nodes.
I've learned that 'return' runs a local function inside an object.
I've learned that you are supposed to put your box-sizing element, most commonly as border-box, in the * section of style.css.
I've learned how to search through to see what commands are available for console.log, understanding that there are many more still to learn.
