# LJ Code 301 - Day 01

I learned a boat-load of information today. Responsive Web Design, SMACSS, @media Queries (still pretty fuzzy on this one), mobile first design, and some new CSS design rules, making me a **little** bit more comfortable with my CSSS skill.

I certainly felt like I was drinking from a fire hose today!!
