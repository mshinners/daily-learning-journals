# LJ Code 301 - Day 13

Today, I learned a great deal about how code interacts with one another. Going through the pok√©dex build, things made a little more sense to me. At the beginning of every new component, when you asked someone 'What do we do here?', I feel completely lost here, but as that section gets started, I can follow along and have an idea (some right, some wrong) about what goes next, or proper syntax, etc.

I still cant express it in words, as to specifics of what I learned, but I feel a slightly better sense of confidence proceeding forward. Still very nervous.
