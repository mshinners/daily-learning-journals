# LJ Code 201 - Day 18

Today I learned how to better use attributes, IDs and other properties in .JS. I am beginning to be able to understand JS better when reading existing code, and understanding how to better write certain parts of it. I can better CSS a page, with an understanding of different contextual ideas.

I haven't mentioned anything about Git/Github lately, but I am also more comfortable in the procedural process and logic of these tools. I am comfortable with the ACP process and do it regularly.
