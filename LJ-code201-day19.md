# LJ Code 201 - Day 19

Today I learned that this is the Last Learning Journal I'll need to complete for a week. But seriously, I learned the importance of doing a CSS clear before starting a project. I ran into some webkit things that couldn't be removed that altered my layout a bit.

I learned that screen resolution affects your app's layout. The projector changes the resolution of my laptop, slightly distorting the layout.

This class has taught me so much. The amount of growth I've had during more 4 weeks here has been amazing. I've learned that you are a great teach and/or CF is a great program. The stacked learning module kicks your butt, makes you questions yourself and makes you cry a little bit, but I believe it'll be worth eh struggle.
