# LJ Code 201 - Day 11

Today I learned....that I no nothing. Well, not really nothing, but very little. I sat down to start my lab, and could think of nothing to start, other than the basics of what was in the instructions. It wasn't until I asked someone for advice on what to do could I put some code on the screen. But I made it through.

I did get some work with While loops, which I hadn't done since the 2nd day (or thereabouts.) The struggle continued through the whole day of code, but I figured some things out; understanding a more bits of the code than I hadn't before.

I also learned about meet-up tonight. I went to my first JS hackers meet-up and got a clue as to what to expect with those. It wasn't as chatty as I thought it might be but it was worth going to check out. I think I wont be back until (at the very least) 201 is over. I need more time on my code.
