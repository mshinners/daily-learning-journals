# LJ Code 201 - Day 12

Today I made some good progress with my assignment. I finally got though Monday's work and most of Tuesday's as well, and then I think I even got everything done for today, although the graphing isn't working properly so its kinda hard to tell.

I learned all about local storage and what at least some of it's uses can be for. Im sure there are hundreds of implementations for it, but I understand the concept of and for it.

I was again reminded of the power of pair-programming. Working on the same challenges together just makes it work better. Not always successfully, but at least theres validation if both of you cant figure it out.

And one of the last things I learned tonight was about Dr. Who. I decided to attend the Dr. Who viewing tonight at CF and got more than I could have imagined. Now, my primary reason wasn't really for the show, although I had been interested in checking out the phenomenon, my main thought about attending was to Network. And I struck it big. I met one of your former Python students and CF Alumni, Maelle Vance. She told me the joys of Python and how she has a great job using it and how her company thinks quite highly of CF grads. That was a real pleasure talking with her.
