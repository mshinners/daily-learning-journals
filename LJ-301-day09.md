# LJ Code 301 - Day 09


Today I learned, that learning is painful. Today was a hard day for me. Doubt didn't creep in, he kicked down the door asked me what I was doing here.
I can understand most concepts but I appear to be a much slower learner than most in class. While I continue to learn, my brain is just failing to keep up and stay focused. I can manage to complete assignments and keep up only through searching online for help, asking classmates for help or just muddling through each problem.

Today, we built a grocery store. Really we built a backend database for it. This did really help me to understand what a database is, what the backend is and understand the structure about tables. I understand the basic idea of 'JOIN', I understand the commands, but how to structure and what to write and where baffles me. If you sat me down in front of a blank screen and told me to create a thing, I would either laugh, or break down and cry....probably the later.
