# LJ Code 201 - Day 14

I learned three big things today.

I learned some cool CSS trickery during lecture time that will come in handy for our group project.

Working with a strong coder in Nathan today during pair-programming was an amazingly eye-opening experience. With him talking through some of the more complex code that I still struggled to fully grasp, I had more than a few "ah-ha moments." It was extremely helpful.

Lastly, I was really struggling to locate some error in my code that was breaking all the things. I took my issue to Brandon, who helped me search for it for nearly a half hour. He showed me some great debugging methods that delved deeper into the console than I really knew existed. Watching and learning as he systematically discovered the key issue was encouraging. I hope that one day I can look at my code that way and solve my own problems.
