# LJ Code 201 - Day 16

Today was the first day of project week. Working together with Nathan, Shannon & Michelle, I was able be a part of a team once again. I thrive in team projects, where I can have thoughtful and creative contributions to the team, while being able to get assistance in areas in which I am week. I appreciate having a competent and cooperative teammates, that makes all the difference between success and mediocrity.

With the partnership of one of my teammates, Shannon, I was able to learn and grow more in my coding ability. She worked with me and taught me in areas that I just still do not comprehend. My hope (and belief in the program's structure) is that through repetitive practice in the various concepts that these will begin to take root in my mind and become ingrained in me and they will be better understood.
