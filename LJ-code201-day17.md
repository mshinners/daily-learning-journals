# LJ Code 201 - Day 16

Today was a frustrating day. I spent too much time on a group problem that was not teaching me anything (trying to format the word library.) I finally got through that and then dealt with a couple more troubling problems, But these issues were helping me learn. One was a CSS layout issue, which didn't take too long, but did help me learn to use an additional layer of div to solve a layout problem I was having. I did spend a considerable amount of time working on a particular feature that was new to me. I still don't have it completely figured out but plan to conquer that Wednesday.

I attended the event at Ratio last night which was very enlightening. I got a good visual of what the average day of a Dev looks like. I continued my networking by meeting several CF alumni, upper classmen, and some senior staff at a tech company of which before this event, I never knew existed.
