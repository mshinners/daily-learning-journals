# LJ Code 201 - Day 15

Today, I learnt in more detail what to expect in 301, how to collaborate with my teammates and further growth in JS. Later, I really focused on some concerted effort into CSS. I studied more overall which helped me be more successful in the 301 exam.

I am ready to rock n roll project week, learn as much as I can working with my teammates so I can be as prepared  as possible to get set for 301.
