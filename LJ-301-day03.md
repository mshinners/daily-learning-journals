# LJ Code 301 - Day 03

Today, I learned that I am a slow learner. Why, you ask? Well, it took me all of 201 and 1/2 of the 1st week of 301 to realize and utilize a very valuable tool....your code! Using code from code demos and (especially helpful today was the Blog lab code) gave me a 'template' from which to structure parts of my code. This has always been my biggest struggle; knowing what to place where and when. I feel this revelation may have loosened up a log-jam in my mind, and will help me to get more of the jigsaw puzzle better into shape. While not even close to getting all the right pieces into place, I can start form combined parts of the overall picture. I can see progress today! And after today's code review, I feel I've had greater retention. Certainly putting this day in the 'WIN' column.
