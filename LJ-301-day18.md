# LJ Code 301 - Day 18

Today I learned quite a bit about the path the code takes to go between client side, server side and APIs.  Others seem to get the flow much better, but I have to think through it much more deliberately and often need things explained to me. But I am most confidently sure that I have a substantial amount of growth in understanding in these processes. I could make sense of what was going where, when and why. It's still a bit esoteric to me, but I know that there was growth of clarity today. That, and having good success in our app today has given me a boost of confidence moving forward.
