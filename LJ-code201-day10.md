# LJ Code 201 - Day 9

Today... was an inspiring day. Watching the final projects from 401 gave me a glimpse into the possible. Seeing their creations was quite interesting.

In lecture (and reading), I learned a little about Order of Operations, and Debugging.

But where I feel I really had some growth was in our paired programming today. Previously, I had not spent much time working on CSS, for 2 reasons. I would get stuck on not getting something to work properly and would put it on the shelf. And secondly, I had higher priority items to worry about, namely JS.
