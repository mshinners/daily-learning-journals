# LJ Code 301 - Day 02

I learned about jQuery today! Woo! If I can figure our the concept of how to use it in my everyday code, I know it'll really help make things easier and shorter. I understand in daily code demos how things can change, I just cant wrap my head around how to put them into practice. It still seems so abstract to me. Everything I saw on the screen made sense to me, but when I sit in front of my screen, I draw a blank. But whats wore, its confusing me to the point that I'm having trouble putting together a constructor or a for loop. That may be a bit of an exaggeration, but things are getting foggier for me, not clearer. When other students are screaming at you that this would have made things so much easier for Salmon Cookies, Im just sitting there trying to picture what we did in Salmon cookies and how that snippet could have changed things and just draw a blank.
