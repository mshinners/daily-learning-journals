# LJ Code 301 - Day 05

Today, I've learned that there may be no limit to a person's capacity to stuff more things into their brain. I continue to surprise myself with the ability to learn more and more....after I think I may have already topped off to limits of my brain. It's pretty amazing.

During code review today, I felt I got a better grasp on certain aspects of the code. Handlebars makes much more sense to me than it did yesterday (which isn't saying much, seeing as yesterdays comprehension I might grade somewhere between 5-8%.) So, I may have doubled that by getting up to somewhere around 15-20% (just of what you've taught us.) jQuery continues to grow on me and I can better visualize how to use it. That's all I can think of for now. My brain is quite exhausted.
