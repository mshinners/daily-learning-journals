# LJ Code 301 - Day 15

Today, I learned very similarly to what I did yesterday. I can't really quantify what specifics I learned today, I just have a increased vision of what the overall code is doing. Building the Pok√©dex really aided in my understanding of the overall app-building process. I think I can better comprehend how jQuery works, have a good understanding of template literals, and am getting a firmer hold on Handlebars (ha, pun NOT intended, but I'm not going to change it.) The process as a whole is still difficult. When you ask someone how they would start a piece of code, I'm more often than not at a loss at where to start. But, once it gets going, I can often pick up on it and know roughly what comes next. My goal is that next week's project will help me to further solidify my understanding, at least into something with the consistency of Jell-o.
